# CalderaDynamicRupture
Code accompanying the publication: 

#### Dynamic rupture simulations of caldera collapse earthquakes: Effects of wave radiation, magma viscosity, and evidence of complex nucleation at Kilauea 2018

The directory 'analysis/' contains the following scripts:
1. impedance_fault.m: Analyze for the impedance to antiplane ring fault slip in Fourier domain. 
2. Invert4Maxwell.m: Optimize for SeisSol input parameters that approximate the desired relaxation functions for Maxwell rheology.
3. RadiationDamping.m: Demonstrate the effect of radiation damping on a single collapse earthquake (based on the lumped model of Wang et al., 2022).
4. radiationEffectInRS: Demonstrate the effect of radiation damping on a sequence of collapse earthquakes (based on the lumped model of Segall and Anderson, 2022).
