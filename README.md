# CalderaDynamicRupture
Code accompanying the publication: 

#### Dynamic rupture simulations of caldera collapse earthquakes: Effects of wave radiation, magma viscosity, and evidence of complex nucleation at Kilauea 2018

The code contains the following scripts:
1. impedance_fault.m: Impedance analyses for antiplane ring fault slip in Fourier domain. 
2. Invert4Maxwell.m: Inversion procedure to fit the desired relaxation functions for Maxwell rheology.
3. RadiationDamping.m: Demonstrate the effect of radiation damping on collapse dynamics via a modified lumped model.
4. radiationEffectInRS: Script to demonstrate the effects of neglecting radiation damping in rate-and-state based lumped model.
